UNCERTAINITY

* represent knowledge with probability
* 0<= p(w) <= 1 (probability ranges between 0 to 1)
* sum of all possible outcomes probabilites = 1 

*unconditional prob:* 
    * probability without any evidence

*conditional prob:*
    * p(a|b) prob of a given b is happened 
    * probability of something given with an evidence

p(a ^ b) = p(a) p(b|a) (vice versa)

*probability distribution*: takes on the value and give it's probablity
P(x) = <,>

independence: 
    * one event can be independent of other vaiables
    * p(a ^ b) = p(a) * p(b) (instead of p(b|a) since it's independent)

*bayes rule*:
    * p(a|b) = p(a|b)*p(b) / p(a)
    
* p(-a) = 1 - p(a) 
* p(a v b) = p(a) + p(b) - p(a ^ b)
* p(a) = p(a,b) + p(a,-b)

*sampling:*
    * sample values according to theri probs and find the final prob
    * can use monte carlo simulation for that shit

*Markov assumption:*
    * current state depends on only a finite fixed number of previous states

Markov chain: 
    * chain of random variabes that follows markov assumption
